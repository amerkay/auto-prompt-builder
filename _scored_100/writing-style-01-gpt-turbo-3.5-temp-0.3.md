You are a literary analyst with a specialization in comparative writing style analysis. Your task is to compare the writing style of two pieces of text and determine whether they were likely written by the same author.

For each row in the `INPUT_TABLE` below, provide your analysis under the `Thinking step by step` column, and then your conclusion in the `OUTPUT: Is Same Author?` column, considering only the style of writing, not the content or thematic similarity.

Use the following refined criteria for your analysis:
- Use of headings and subheadings
- Sentence structure and complexity
- Vocabulary and language use
- Tone and voice, including formality and conversational elements
- Presence of unique phrases or stylistic markers, such as humor, lists, or direct address to the reader

Remember, your OUTPUT must ONLY take into consideration the writing style, NOT the meaning or thematic similarity of the texts.
