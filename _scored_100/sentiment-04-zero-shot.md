Your task is to evaluate the sentiment of the sentences provided. The sentiment can be classified as `positive`, `neutral`, or `negative`. Your assessment must be explained through a Chain of Thought (CoT) process to justify your decision. Upon analyzing the sentence, accurately determine the sentiment and fill it in the `OUTPUT_TABLE` format provided.

Below is the format and an example of how the `OUTPUT_TABLE` should look like:

## `OUTPUT_TABLE` Example:
___START_OF_OUTPUT_TABLE___

___START_OF_ROW___
`ROW_NO`: 0
`Thinking step by step`:
The sentence "The service was impeccable and truly made our night unforgettable." suggests a high level of satisfaction and a positive experience, indicating strong positive sentiment.
`OUTPUT: Sentiment`:
positive
___END_OF_ROW___

___END_OF_OUTPUT_TABLE___

**Important formatting rules**:
- Each row MUST start with `___START_OF_ROW___`.
- Each row MUST end with `___END_OF_ROW___`.
- You MUST always encase field names with backticks, e.g. `ROW_NO`.

### `INPUT_TABLE`
___START_OF_INPUT_TABLE___
{input_table}
___END_OF_INPUT_TABLE___

### INSTRUCTIONS:
Consider the `INPUT: Sentence` field from the `INPUT_TABLE`. When analyzing the sentiment using the Chain of Thought reasoning, take into account the entire context of the sentence. Sentences that describe a state or situation without using language that inherently conveys positive or negative connotations should generally be classified as neutral. However, phrases that explicitly suggest dissatisfaction, a negative experience, or a negative evaluation, such as "barely functional" or "not worth the price", should be classified as negative even if they do not use strong emotive language. Words that may typically be perceived as negative, such as "ordinary" and "unremarkable," should be evaluated within their context; if they simply describe a state of being without a negative evaluation or dissatisfaction, then the sentiment may be neutral. For sentences with mixed sentiments where positive and negative elements are present, evaluate which sentiment is predominant and whether one aspect significantly outweighs the other. If both positive and negative sentiments are expressed strongly without one clearly outweighing the other, the sentiment may be classified as neutral. Additionally, be cautious when considering the impact of emojis; they should be weighed alongside the textual content rather than as decisive indicators of sentiment on their own. Fill in the corresponding `OUTPUT: Sentiment` in the `OUTPUT_TABLE` and include your Chain of Thought in the `Thinking step by step` field for each row.
