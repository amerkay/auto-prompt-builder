## How Much Do Travel Nurses Make?

Do travel nurses earn more money than full-time registered nurses? Overall, definitely!

Keep in mind: Travel nurses make higher salaries on average.

Your potential average annual income will depend on demand for your nursing specialty and where you work.

The averages you see below are measured across all specialties and locations nationwide for a general comparison.

## Is Travel Nursing Worth It?

If you're looking to get more satisfaction in your nursing career, it could definitely be worth it.

It turns out it really is better to be a travel nurse than a staff nurse. A sweeping study analyzing feedback straight from our fellow nurses confirms it.

[Travel nurses report higher satisfaction and less workplace stress](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-solve-nursing-crisis/) in their jobs than permanent staff nurses.

Nurses working in travel nurse jobs are more satisfied than permanent staff nurses in key areas:

- better job satisfaction
- less work-related stress
- feeling safer on the job
- more employer support
- higher compensation

Working in a travel nurse job isn't easy, but it could elevate your bedside nursing practice and give you more control in your nursing career.

You'll have to decide if the pros outweigh the cons for yourself. The standard contract is only 13 weeks, so I recommend every nurse give it a try.

_Pro tip: You should definitely take the time to research what to expect before you commit to a travel nurse job._

## Get A Travel Nurse Pay Breakdown

Understanding how travel nurses' higher wages breakdown will help you compare pay offers and spot the jobs that are worth your relocation.

Travel nurses are typically hired as contracted temporary employees of travel nursing agencies, getting paid on a weekly basis to work in a variety of healthcare facilities.

The most common travel nurse contracts offered are for hospital inpatient units in a healthcare facility. These contracts usually commit you to work:

- 12 hours/shift
- 3 shifts/week
- 36 hours/week
- 13 weeks total
- 468 work hours total per contract

Our¬†[**interactive pay explorer**](https://stellarnurse.com/travel-nurse-salary/#salary-box)¬†above standardizes all travel nurse wage data around the average 36-hour weekly pay packages.

### See A Pay Package Example

Here's an average travel nurse pay package offer for a Medical-Surgical Nurse working 36 hours/week:

- $400 M&IE (Meals & Incidental Expenses) - per Week
- $3,200 Housing Stipend - per Month
- $750 Travel Reimbursement - One Time payment
- $30 Base Rate - Hourly pay rate

It's confusing!¬†**¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø**

Let's break this offer down to view your pay per week and per hour. Convert all parts of your travel nurse wages to a standardized hourly rate, then combine to calculate.

Your "M&IE" (meals & incidental expenses) payment is meant to cover your living expenses and daily (diem) meal costs on assignment.

Your housing stipend covers your temporary housing in your assignment location. Remember you should be maintaining housing in your permanent tax home, as well.

Many travel nursing offer travel reimbursements to help offset the higher cost of life on the road.

|Pay Package Offer|Pay per Week (36 hrs)|Hourly rates|
|---|---|---|
|$400 M&IE Weekly|$400|$11.11|
|$3,200 Housing Stipend Monthly|$800|$22.22|
|$750 Travel Reimbursement One-time|$57.69|$1.60|
|$30 Base Rate Hourly|$1,080|$30|
|**Total Gross Pay (Pre-Taxes)**|**$2,337.69**|**$64.94**|

Be aware you may have more living expenses coming out of your travel nursing paycheck, based on what employment benefits package you accept:

- Taxes based on your permanent tax home rates
- Agency health insurance - health benefits can start at $20/week
- Agency 401k retirement plans

Ask your agency what other benefits they provide and how those affect your pay package.

### Taxable vs Tax Free Pay

Following on from our pay example above, your travel nurse pay is made up of a taxable hourly wage and tax free income.

|Weekly Income per Offer|Taxable?|
|---|---|
|$400 M&IE (Meals & Incidental Expenses)|N|
|$800 Housing Stipend|N|
|$57.69 Travel Reimbursement|N|
|$1,080 Hourly Base Rate|**Y**|
|**$2,337.69 Total**|**$1,080 Taxed**|

Notice that more than half of this pay package is tax free pay. Ka-ching!

Your tax free stipends, or "Per Diem" pay, are based on daily maximum rates set by the government. ¬†Check¬†[**gsa.gov's Per Diem rates**](https://gsa.gov/travel/plan-book/per-diem-rates/)¬†for your next contract location.

Travel nurses are eligible for Per Diem tax free stipends when working away from your permanent tax home. When receiving tax free pay you MUST duplicate living/housing expenses, required per IRS rules.

This means paying fair market prices for both your accommodation at your travel nursing assignment, AND maintaining your own housing at your permanent tax home.

Many agencies also offer travel reimbursements to help you get money back you spent on travel expenses moving between assignments.

_Pro tip: You can still "travel nurse" while living in your own housing at your permanent tax home. The difference is your income will be fully taxed, and you won't be eligible for the the tax free travel nursing pay._
