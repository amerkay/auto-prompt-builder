# The Best Travel Nursing Companies 2022

The best travel nursing companies for 2022 are here! To determine our list, we evaluated over 380 travel nursing agencies by aggregating over 108,000 reviews from 6 leading review sources. We selected the 20 highest rated companies based on our transparent scoring system which we describe in detail below.

This is our sixth year of spending massive amounts of time aggregating review scores for hundreds of travel nursing agencies to surface the highest scoring agencies. We are compelled to do this each year for several reasons.

## Why It’s Important and Difficult to Find the Best Travel Nursing Agencies

First, we have a deep appreciation for how important and difficult it is for travel nurses to find the right agencies to work with. Travel nurses rely on agencies to provide a robust and impactful set of services. Therefore, the service, or lack thereof, can have a profound impact on both a nurse’s career and personal life.

### Increase in Number of Travel Nursing Agencies

Meanwhile, it’s become exceedingly difficult in recent years to find the best travel nursing companies on your own. The pandemic driven boom in the travel nursing industry has resulted in a massive increase in the already large number of agencies.

### Increase in Best Travel Nursing Agency Lists

The boom has also brought increased attention to the travel nursing industry. As a result, there are now tons of different “best travel nursing company” lists. Unfortunately, these lists are often subpar and sometimes completely meaningless.

For example, this year we see lists of “The Best Travel Nursing Companies of 2022” that are unchanged from 2021 and even 2020. Basically, the websites created a list several years ago and now they just update the year on the list in order to trick Google into thinking the article is new because they know Google will rank it higher as a result.

[Find your next travel healthcare job on BluePipes!](https://www.bluepipes.com/jobs)

Of course, this behavior is a major disservice to the entire travel nursing industry. There is even one list on page one of Google’s search results that includes travel nursing companies that don’t even exist any longer!

We’ve also seen other lists that rely on a relatively small number of reviews. For example, one list purveyor boasts a survey of ‘the nation’s largest travel healthcare community”. That sounds awesome! However, only a couple thousand community members actually respond.

This might sound like a lot. However, it’s actually a relatively small number all things considered.

### Uneven Review Distribution for Travel Nursing Companies

That’s because there are so many travel nursing agencies. Moreover, travel nurses are unevenly distributed among the agencies. For example, some sources estimate that 50% of all travel nurses work for one of the 25 largest travel nursing companies. That means that the remaining 50% work with the remaining 350+ travel nursing agencies.

Meanwhile, there are tons of different review sources. As a result, reviews are unevenly distributed such that it can be difficult to find a reliable sample size of reviews on any one review source.

## How we Determine the Best Travel Nursing Agencies for 2022

For these reasons, we aggregate the review scores from 6 leading review sources for every travel nursing company we can find. To clarify, each year we enter the review counts and scores from each review source for each company into an Excel spreadsheet.

Once we have entered all the data, we program the spreadsheet to run a bunch of calculations to ultimately determine an aggregate score for each company. We compare this year’s scores to last year’s scores and issue bonuses or penalties based on score increases or declines. This way, we award companies that have truly outperformed over the last year.

Our scoring system is quite complex. In the interest of transparency, we provide a complete scoring breakdown for one company at the end of this article.

Here are the 6 review sources we collect scores from:

### Rating Services We Aggregate

1. Highway Hypodermics
2. Travel Nursing Central
3. Facebook
4. Indeed
5. Glassdoor
6. Google

### Highway Hypodermics

Highway Hypodermics has been publishing their own “Top 10 Travel Nursing Companies” list since at least 2005. Their annual list is based on reviews they collect on their own website. We highly recommend reviewing [the list for 2022 here](https://www.highwayhypodermics.com/topten). And we highly recommend [submitting your own reviews here.](https://www.highwayhypodermics.com/agency-evaluation-form)

[Discover the ultimate travel nursing pay calculator.](https://www.bluepipes.com/pay)

We counted a total of 3,633 reviews from HH this year. That’s an increase of 511 from 2021. We should point out that HH only counts scores from the last 5 years in their totals. This way, they keep the review scores fresh which is a really nice touch because it helps travelers understand how a company is performing now.

It’s fair to say that companies are performing well now. The aggregate average score for all companies on HH is 17.96 out of a possible 20. That’s an increase from last year’s 17.71. It’s also an average of 89.8% which indicates that travel nurses are very happy with their travel nursing agencies.

### Travel Nursing Central

We counted 11,753 reviews from Travel Nursing Central this year. That’s an increase of 580 from 2021.

The aggregate average score for all companies on Travel Nursing Central this year was 86.47. That’s an increase from last year’s 86.04. This is another indication that travel nursing companies provided exceptional service over the last year.

### FaceBook

We counted exactly 8,800 reviews from FaceBook this year. That’s an increase of 1,546 reviews from the previous year.

The aggregate average score on FaceBook decreased from 4.83 in 2021 to 4.58 in 2022. However, FaceBook’s reviews were a mess in 2021. For example, FaceBook was showing that some companies had zero reviews when the companies actually had hundreds of reviews. FaceBook was showing that some companies had a negative number of reviews, which is impossible. It was also showing that some companies had “5 stars” even though those companies had tons of negative reviews. The point is that we simply can’t glean anything from FaceBook’s 2021 data because it was riddled with inaccuracies.

### Indeed

We included 42,063 reviews from Indeed this year. That’s an increase of 5,813 from the previous year. Indeed now has by far the most employer reviews of any of the six services we track. We find this dumbfounding given that Indeed offers among the worst and most horrifying job search experiences for travel healthcare professionals. Check out [our job board](https://www.bluepipes.com/jobs) for a much better experience.

The aggregate average score for all travel nursing agencies on Indeed increased ever so slightly from 3.73 in 2021 to 3.74 in 2022.

### GlassDoor

GlassDoor came in with 28,801 reviews this year. That’s an increase of 8,045 from last year.

The aggregate average score for all travel nursing companies on GlassDoor was 3.87 this year. That’s a slight increase from 3.81 last year.

### Google

We counted 13,475 reviews from Google this year. That’s an increase of 6,537 from last year. That’s almost a 100% increase. Google is growing reviews at a very fast pace.

The aggregate average score for all travel nursing companies on Google was 4.57 this year. That’s an increase from 4.46 last year.

### Interesting Observations on the Overall Numbers

There are a couple of interesting observations in this year’s overall numbers and the list of best travel nursing companies these numbers resulted in. First, we find it absolutely amazing that the aggregate average score for all companies was up from 2021 to 2022. Please note that we collect the scores during the last 2 weeks of May. Therefore, this year’s list covers June of 2021 through May of 2022.

#### Travel Nursing Agencies Provided Good Service During Covid

This is a period that saw both the Delta and Omicron hospitalization spikes. This means that agencies were employing record numbers of travelers. The agencies’ operational systems like credentialing and payroll were definitely stressed this past year. Despite this, agencies clearly performed well.

[The original Universal Profile and Credential Management for travelers.](https://www.bluepipes.com/travel-nursing)

It’s also a period that saw a huge draw down in hospitalizations. This resulted in [contract cancellations](https://blog.bluepipes.com/travel-nursing-contract-cancelled/), bill rate reductions and other unsavory circumstances. Here again, agencies appear to have handled these issues well.

#### “Recruiterless” Services Still Absent from the List

Second, we find it interesting that over 6 years into the “recruiterless” healthcare staffing experiment, not one “recruiterless” staffing agency has made our list…ever.

To be fair, this isn’t to say that any of these companies has horrifyingly bad reviews. It’s just that none of them have great reviews despite their promises of transformational service, demonization of recruiters and traditional healthcare staffing, and absolutely massive capital expenditures and losses.

The highest that any of these companies ranked on our list this year was at number 57. All 20 companies on our list continue to employ a traditional high-touch approach. It would seem as though travel nurses still highly value this type of service.

That said, we should point out that one company on our list does have a very powerful “self-service platform”. That company is [Stability Healthcare](https://stabilityhealthcare.com/) and they ranked number 4 on this year’s list.

## Why You Should Consider ALL The Best Travel Nursing Companies

We realize that 20 seems like a large number for a “best of” list. However, we have very good reasons to include 20 companies on our list and we strongly encourage you to consider all of them. Here is why.

Fist, all of these companies deserve to be on a “best of” list. Every single one of them has an aggregate average score of greater than 90 out of 100. This is exceptionally high for employment satisfaction. In fact, these scores would be high enough to get them on GlassDoor’s annual list of the best companies in the nation to work for.

Second, service offerings vary dramatically from agency to agency. Organizational structures also differ. We want you to be able to find the right fit all in one place.

[Free eBook: How To Negotiate Travel Nursing Pay](https://www.bluepipes.com/negotiate)

Finally, [different companies have access to different jobs](https://blog.bluepipes.com/finding-travel-nursing-companies-that-work-in-your-desired-destinations/). Every experienced traveler will tell you that [must work with multiple agencies](https://blog.bluepipes.com/travel-nursing-agencies-how-many-should-you-work-with/). Also, you should ask agencies about their access to the job markets you’re most interested in so you can find the agencies that can get you jobs where you want to go.

Therefore, we highly recommend working a minimum 4 agencies. In fact, we think 7 agencies is even better.

## Background Info on Best Travel Nursing Companies List

If you consider all 20 companies on this list, then we are confident that you’ll find many that can meet your every need. That said, we want you to have confidence that our list is legit. Therefore, we’ll spend the rest of the article discussing issues you should be aware of and providing a detailed breakdown of our scoring system.

### Review Sources and Score Collection

First, we do not use reviews from our own website. We also do not accept any money whatsoever in exchange for placement on the list.

Instead, we collect review-counts and scores from 6 leading review sources for every company we can find on any of those sources. We enter the scores into a spreadsheet and run the calculations as we describe below.

We only use publicly accessible review sources. This means that anyone is free to leave a review in accordance with the guidelines. This also means that we do not use “pay to play” review sources.

The websites we use are below:

### Rating Services We Aggregate

1. Highway Hypodermics
2. Travel Nursing Central
3. Facebook
4. Indeed
5. Glassdoor
6. Google

#### Internal Staff and Travel Nursing Reviews

Only travel healthcare professionals can leave reviews on Highway Hypodermics and Travel Nursing Central. The other review sources accept reviews from both internal employees and travelers.

Some argue that this allows staffing agencies to stack reviews from internal employees on every review source in an effort to make it look like the company is amazing. To counter this, we require a minimum of 50 total reviews from travel healthcare professionals and a minimum of 15 within the previous year in order for a company to qualify to be on our list.

Moreover, we believe it’s useful and important to include reviews from both internal staff and travelers. Here’s why.

First, Google, FaceBook, Indeed and GlassDoor each receive way more traffic than the industry specific websites. That means that these services have more reviews for more companies. Additionally, it means that more people actually see these reviews so their impact is more far reaching. Therefore, we get a clearer picture of how these companies are perceived if we use these review sources.

Perhaps more importantly, we strongly believe that happy internal employees are good for travel nurses. Happy employees have lower turnover which means a more cohesive and experienced team for travel nurses.

### Fake Reviews and Review Solicitation

We understand that fake reviews exist. As a result, we thoroughly check the reviews of each company that qualifies for our list. Over the years, we’ve discovered fake reviews for several companies. We permanently ban those companies from ever being on our list.

[Create your free Travel Healthcare Resume on BluePipes!](https://www.bluepipes.com/travel-nursing)

We also know that “review solicitation” exists. We do not think this is a problem unless the company pays for reviews. We believe it’s normal for companies to ask customers and staff to leave them reviews. If we see that companies pay for reviews, then we disqualify them.

### Sample Size and Minimum Requirements

We also have minimum requirements for companies to make it on the list and receive bonuses or penalties. These requirements help solve problems related to sample size.

First, we require a minimum of 50 reviews to make it on the list. We also require a minimum of 15 reviews from healthcare professionals within the last year. We have similar requirements for bonuses and penalties.

We do this to ensure that we have adequate sample sizes. For example, if a company has ten 5-star reviews, then they would have a score of 100 which is really high. However, ten is a very small sample size so it doesn’t necessarily tell us that the company provides 5-star service to their travelers.

We realize that these rules make it very challenging for the smallest healthcare staffing companies. Despite this, we’ve had many very small agencies make our list over the years. Moreover, we believe it’s important for a company to be large enough to handle the volume of inquiries that comes with being listed as one of the best travel nursing agencies in the nation.

## Sample Breakdown of our Best Travel Nursing Agency Scoring System

Next, we provide a complete breakdown of the scoring for one of the companies on our list so you can see exactly how it works. We’ll use Travel Nurse Across America’s scores. TNAA is number 6 on our list this year.

### Meeting the Minimum Requirements

First, we collect the review-counts and review scores from the 6 review services and enter them into our spreadsheet. Next, we add the number of scores together to get the total number of scores across all review sources. At this point, our minimum requirements are as follows:

### Minimum Requirements for Best Travel Nursing Companies

1. A company must have a minimum of 50 total reviews across all platforms. That’s not 50 for each platform, but 50 for all platforms combined.
2. A company must have a minimum of 15 new reviews from healthcare professionals in the last year.

Again, these requirements ensure that we have an adequate sample size.

TNAA has 2,114 total reviews. Therefore, they meet our minimum requirement of 50.

### Calculating the Aggregate Average Score

After we enter all the review scores into our spreadsheet, we’re ready to calculate the aggregate average score.

To do so, we must convert all the scores to a common scoring scale. That’s because the review sources use three different scales between them. TNC uses a 100-point scale. HH uses a 20-point scale. The others use a 5-point scale. We convert them all to a 100-point scale.

Here are the scores we collected for TNAA this year:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
TNAA Reviews
|Source|Scores|Average|
|Travel Nursing Central|1,022|93.03|
|Highway Hypodermics|351|17.7|
|Facebook|230|4.8|
|Indeed|89|4.1|
|GlassDoor|78|4.6|
|Google|344|4.9|

Next, we add the number of reviews together to arrive at the total number of reviews.

|   |   |
|---|---|
TNAA Total No. of Reviews
|Travel Nursing Central|1,022|
|Highway Hypodermics|351|
|Facebook|230|
|Indeed|89|
|GlassDoor|78|
|Google|344|
|TOTAL|2,114|

Next, we calculate the weighted total for each review source. This is also where we convert all the scores to a 100-point scale. To do so, we multiply the scores by 20 for the rating services that use 5-point scales. We multiply by 5 for the rating service that uses a 20-point scale.

Here is how that breaks down for TNAA in 2022.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
TNAA Weighted Total Value
|Source|Equation|Total|
|Travel Nursing Central|1,022 * 93.03|95,076.66|
|Highway Hypodermics|351 * 17.7 * 5|31,063.50|
|Facebook|230 * 4.8 * 20|22,080|
|Indeed|89 * 4.1 * 20|7,298|
|GlassDoor|78 * 4.6 * 20|7,176|
|Google|344 * 4.9 * 20|33,712|
|TOTAL|SUM|196,406.16|

Finally, we divide the weighted aggregate total by the total number of reviews to get the aggregate average score. Here is TNAA’s calculation for 2022:

|   |

TNAA Weighted Total Value
|Weighted Aggregate Average Score|
|196,406.16 / 2,114 = 92.90736045411542|

### Aggregate Difference Score

With the aggregate average score for 2022, we can now calculate the “aggregate difference score”. This score rewards or penalizes a company based on the difference between this year’s aggregate average score and last year’s aggregate average score.

We follow the following guidelines for the aggregate difference score:

### Minimum Requirements for the Aggregate Difference Score

1. To qualify for this score, a company must have had more than 50 total reviews in the previous year. This qualification ensures some modicum of adequate sample size.
2. We cap this score at plus or minus 5 points per company. This qualification also works to ensure some modicum of adequate sample size.

Let’s take a look at this score for our sample company. TNAA’s aggregate average score for 2021 was 92.10824089. Their aggregate average score for 2022 is 92.90736045.

So, we subtract 92.10824089 from 92.90736045. We are left with + 0.79911956.

Therefore, TNAA receives a bonus of + 0.79911956 added to their aggregate average score for 2022. 92.90736045 + 0.79911956 = 93.70648001.

And yes, all those decimal places are necessary. For example, our number 10 and 11 companies are separated by less than .08 of a point.

### The Individual Difference Score

Finally, we calculate an “individual difference score” for each rating service. This score is similar to the aggregate difference score. However, in this case, we give bonuses or penalties based on the difference between last year’s score and this year’s score for each rating service.

The Individual Difference Score has several guidelines and qualifiers. We choose to keep this scoring mechanism private to ensure that content farms and other rapscallions can’t easily reproduce our scoring system.

However, please contact us if you are a traveler or staffing agency who would like a full breakdown of everything. We’ll gladly reveal and discuss all the calculations, guidelines and qualifiers.

Wow, that was a lot of nerdy number crunching! Are you still awake?! If so, then you’re probably ready for a nap!! But, you’re an expert on our scoring system.
