## Background on Nursing Job Search Book

The title of the book is [Your Last Nursing Class: How to Land Your First Nursing Job](https://www.amazon.com/Your-Last-Nursing-Class-ultimate-ebook/dp/B071ZZHY1R/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1499119965&sr=8-1&keywords=your+last+nursing+class). It was published on June 4th, 2017. The Author is [Beth Hawkes MSN, RN-BC](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bethhawkes/). Beth is a highly experienced Registered Nurse with a broad background. She has worked as a nurse manager in an acute care setting where she was directly involved in the hiring process. She currently works as a Nursing Professional Development Specialist for one of the nation’s largest non-profit health systems. She also writes a [career advice column](http://allnurses.com/nursing-advice-column/) on allnurses.com, the nation’s largest nursing forum. And she has her own website, [NurseCode.com](http://nursecode.com/), where she offers career advice and discusses all things nursing. To say Beth is qualified to pen a book on this topic is an understatement.

It’s worth noting that I previously worked for a national healthcare staffing company. I worked with literally thousands of candidates on finding permanent, travel and PRN positions. I submitted over 1,500 candidates for job consideration. I spoke with hundreds of nursing managers all across the country. I was engaged in the nursing job search process for 50 to 60 hours per week, every week, for over 5 years.

I mention this because even with this level of experience, I learned a lot from this book. It provided me with new insight into certain aspects of the process. It also shed new light on actions I have long recommended which helped me gain a deeper understanding of the process as a whole.

## About Your Last Nursing Class: How To Land Your First Nursing Job

### Nursing Job Outlook

Your Last Nursing Class covers each aspect of the hiring process for registered nurses. The book begins with an overview of the job outlook for registered nurses. Beth provides an explanation for [why it’s so difficult for new-grad RNs to land their first job](https://blog.bluepipes.com/nursing-students-must-know-rn-job-market/) despite the fact that everyone believes there is a nursing shortage. Understanding this mystery provides both comfort and direction for job seekers.

### Nursing Job Application Process

The book then discusses the job application process. Beth points out some of the common pitfalls and how to avoid them. She provides details on when to apply and how to apply so that you won’t be caught off guard.

### Nurse Hiring: The Internal Framework

Next, the book dives into the internal framework of the hiring process. This includes an insightful description of the various players involved and their respective roles within the process. Knowing the roles of the recruiters, human resources professionals, nurse managers and unit team members is highly beneficial for job seekers. Perhaps more importantly, this section lets you know how to discover information about potential employers and use it to enhance your chances of landing a job.

### How to Present Yourself as a Nursing Job Candidate

This section segues nicely into the next section covering the important topic of how to present yourself as a job candidate. While this is a brief section, it’s importance cannot be underestimated. My experience as a recruiter indicates that the vast majority of candidates get this wrong. When presenting themselves, they discuss why this is the perfect job for them. Instead, they should be presenting themselves as a solution to the employer’s most pressing challenges. Beth explains how to accomplish this.

### Networking for Nursing Jobs

Of course, the easiest person to present yourself to is the one you already know. Beth covers the importance of networking and how to approach it in order to achieve maximum results.

### Licenses and Certifications for the Nursing Job Search

That said, it’s important to note that nursing is a profession in which you can’t get a job without the required licenses and certifications no matter who you know. As a result, nursing job candidates often wonder which certifications are mandatory or worth acquiring in an effort to enhance their chances of landing a job. The book covers this topic in great detail so candidates can confidently focus their efforts.
