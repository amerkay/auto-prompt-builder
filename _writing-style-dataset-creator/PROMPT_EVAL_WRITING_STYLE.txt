Analyze the two texts TEXT_1 and TEXT_2, focusing on detailed lexical choices and syntactic structures. Incorporate stylistic device analysis, such as metaphors, similes, and alliteration. Evaluate the likelihood of the same authorship from 1 to 10, based on similarities in word usage, sentence construction, and stylistic elements. Rate the probability of the same authorship on a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 signifies a low likelihood and 10 indicates a very high likelihood.
