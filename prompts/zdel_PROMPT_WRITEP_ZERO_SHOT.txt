## Example Response:

<prompt>
You are an amazing SEO expert. You are tasked with categorizing SEO keywords.

For each row in the `INPUT_TABLE` below, determine the `OUTPUT: Intent` column by following a Chain of Thought (CoT) process under the column `Thinking step by step`. Use the `INPUT: Value Proposition` and `INPUT: Keyword` fields to guide your categorization.

The `OUTPUT: Intent` is the searcher's intent:
1. **Commercial Intent**: These queries show an intention to buy in the near future but are usually about comparing products or looking for deals. They often include words like "best", "review", or "cheap".
2. **Transactional Intent**: Here, the searcher is ready to make a purchase or perform another specific online activity. Phrases like "buy", "subscribe", or "download" are common.
3. **Navigational Intent**: This is when the user is trying to get to a specific website or page. It usually involves the name of a brand or service.
4. **Informational Intent**: These searches are done to find information. They are usually questions or queries about a specific topic, like "how to" or "what is".


## OUTPUT_TABLE formatting (example):
You MUST format `OUTPUT_TABLE` rows as follows:
___START_OF_OUTPUT_TABLE___

___START_OF_ROW___
`ROW_NO`: 1
`Thinking step by step`:
The keyword is looking for providers, indicating a commercial intent.
`OUTPUT: Intent`:
Commercial
___END_OF_ROW___

___END_OF_OUTPUT_TABLE___

### Important formatting rules:
- Each row MUST start with `___START_OF_ROW___`.
- Each row MUST end with `___END_OF_ROW___`.
- You MUST always encase field names with backticks, e.g. `ROW_NO`.


## TASK:

### `INPUT_TABLE`

___START_OF_INPUT_TABLE___
%%%INPUT_TABLE%%%
___END_OF_INPUT_TABLE___

### INSTRUCTIONS:
- Your task is to fill in the `OUTPUT_TABLE` for the `INPUT_TABLE` provided above.

Reply with ONLY the `OUTPUT_TABLE`, no other text as shown above.
</prompt>

# `DATASET_SAMPLES`
{dataset_table}


# YOUR TASK: Write the prompt
Your prompt must also use Chain of Thought prompting (CoT). The CoT reasoning must be positioned after the INPUT(s) and before the OUTPUT answer.

The prompt must include instructions to compute the `OUTPUT` for the provided `INPUT` fields in the `DATASET_SAMPLES` below.

You MUST include `%%%INPUT_TABLE%%%` so that I can replace it with my `INPUT_TABLE` when I run your prompt.

You MUST include the `OUTPUT_TABLE format` section similar to the example prompt above.

You MUST NEVER use curly braces in your reply, as they are reserved.

Your full prompt must be wrapped with `<prompt>` and `</prompt>`.

Take a deep breath, and reply with the best prompt for the `DATASET_SAMPLES` provided.


## Problem Description
{idea_seed}
