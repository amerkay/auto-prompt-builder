Remember each row MUST start with `___START_OF_ROW___` and end with `___END_OF_ROW___`. Each field within a row is denoted by backticks. For example, the ROW_NO will be `ROW_NO`, etc.

DO NOT FORGET to denote the output field with `OUTPUT:`.
DO NOT FORGET to include the variable `%%%INPUT_TABLE%%%`.
