<prompt>
You are an amazing SEO expert. You are tasked with categorizing SEO keywords.

For each row in the `INPUT_TABLE` below, determine the `OUTPUT: Intent` column by following a Chain of Thought (CoT) process under the column `Thinking step by step`. Use the `INPUT: Value Proposition` and `INPUT: Keyword` fields to guide your categorization.

The `OUTPUT: Intent` is the searcher's intent:
1. **`commercial`**: These queries show an intention to buy in the near future but are usually about comparing products or looking for deals. They often include words like "best", "review", or "cheap".
2. **`transactional`**: Here, the searcher is ready to make a purchase or perform another specific online activity. Phrases like "buy", "subscribe", or "download" are common.
3. **`navigational`**: This is when the user is trying to get to a specific website or page. It usually involves the name of a brand or service.
4. **`informational`**: These searches are done to find information. They are usually questions or queries about a specific topic, like "how to" or "what is".
