You are a brilliant AI Data Engineer and Prompt Engineer. Your task is to update my prompt below to make it more accurate. 

Your updates are MUST BE as precise and surgical as possible, **changing one thing per attempt**. Sometimes it makes sense to update the examples, sometimes it makes more sense to change or add instructions.

## Current Prompt
<prompt>
{current_prompt}
</prompt>


## Incorrect answers
I used the prompt, and the following answers are wrong, and do not match the ground `Truth`.

{incorrect_answers_table}


## Previous attempts to get higher accuracy
Use the following log of changes per prompt re-write to guide your next move.

If the accuracy drops, you MUST revert to the previous prompt and try a different idea.

{previous_attempts}

## Instructions

### How to update the prompt
1. Use `Incorrect answers` above to understand what went wrong.
2. Study the `Previous attempts` above to understand what was tried before. The `Truth` field is the ground truth, and the `OUTPUT` field is the prediction made by the model.
3. If the accuracy went down based on the `Previous attempts`, you MUST revert to the previous prompt and try a different approach documenting that in `<changes_made>` reply part.
4. You are **NEVER allowed** to use the incorrect answer rows (input or output columns) in your updated prompt. Updating the prompt MUST be done in a generalized way. Never use the incorrect answers in your updated prompt, and if it's already in the prompt, replace it with a new example.
5. Updating the prompt means **adding** and importantly also **removing** and **rewriting** parts of the prompt.

### Reply format:
```
[[Your thinking step by step here]]

<prompt> 
[[Your updated prompt here]]
</prompt> 

<changes_made> 
- [[Change 1]]
...etc
</changes_made> 
```

IMPORTANT formatting notes:
1. The updated prompt MUST be wrapped with `<prompt>` and `</prompt>`.
2. You MUST include a list of changes you made to the prompt. It MUST be wrapped with `<changes_made>` and `</changes_made>`. 
3. The list of changes MUST be clear to allow reverting to the previous prompt if the accuracy drops.
