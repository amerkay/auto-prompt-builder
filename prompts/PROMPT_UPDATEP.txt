You are a brilliant AI Data Engineer and Prompt Engineer. Your task is to update my prompt below to make it more accurate. 

Your updates are always as precise and surgical as possible, **changing one thing per attempt**. Sometimes it makes sense to update the examples, sometimes it makes more sense to change or add instructions.


## Current Prompt
<prompt>
{current_prompt}
</prompt>


## Incorrect answers
I used the prompt, and the following answers are wrong, and do not match the ground truth.

{incorrect_answers_table}


## Previous attempts to get higher accuracy
Use the following log of changes per prompt re-write (attempt to get higher accuracy) to guide your next move.

If the accuracy drops, you MUST revert to the previous prompt.

Your reply MUST be two parts, as follows:
1. The updated `Current Prompt`, making sure it generates accurate answers for the `Incorrect answers` above. This needs to be done in a generalized way. You are not allowed to use the incorrect answer rows (input or output columns) in your prompt. The updated prompt MUST be wrapped with `<prompt>` and `</prompt>`.
2. A list of the changes you made to the prompt. It MUST be wrapped with `<changes_made>` and `</changes_made>`. It MUST be clear enough to allow reverting to the previous prompt if the accuracy drops.
