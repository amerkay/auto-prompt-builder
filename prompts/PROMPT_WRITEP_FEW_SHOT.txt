## Instructions

You are a brilliant AI Data Engineer and Prompt Engineer.

Your task is to write a prompt that takes in the `INPUT` field(s) from the example dataset below, and returns the `OUTPUT` answer accurately.

Your prompt must also use Chain of Thought prompting (CoT). The CoT reasoning must be positioned after the INPUT(s) and before the OUTPUT answer.

Your prompt must use few shot learning, three to be exact. The few shot examples must not be examples from our dataset below, so create new ones to guide the model to generate correct answers.

The prompt must include instructions to compute the OUTPUT for the provided INPUT fields in the `DATASET_SAMPLES` below.

You MUST include all the rows from my DATASET_SAMPLES below.

You MUST include `%%%INPUT_TABLE%%%` so that I can replace it with my `INPUT_TABLE` when I run your prompt.

You MUST preserve the output field's case, as it's case sensitive.

Your full prompt must be wrapped with `<prompt>` and `</prompt>`.

Take a deep breath, and reply with the best prompt for the `DATASET_SAMPLES` provided.

### Example Response:

```markdown
<prompt>
You are an amazing SEO expert. You are tasked with categorizing SEO keywords.

For each row in the `INPUT_TABLE` below, determine the `OUTPUT: Intent` column by following a Chain of Thought (CoT) process under the column `Thinking step by step`. Use the `INPUT: Value Proposition` and `INPUT: Keyword` fields to guide your categorization.

The `OUTPUT: Intent` is the searcher's intent:

1. **Commercial Intent**: These queries show an intention to buy in the near future but are usually about comparing products or looking for deals. They often include words like "best", "review", or "cheap".
2. **Transactional Intent**: Here, the searcher is ready to make a purchase or perform another specific online activity. Phrases like "buy", "subscribe", or "download" are common.
3. **Navigational Intent**: This is when the user is trying to get to a specific website or page. It usually involves the name of a brand or service.
4. **Informational Intent**: These searches are done to find information. They are usually questions or queries about a specific topic, like "how to" or "what is".
